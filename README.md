# Queueing System Simulator

This program is the individual course project for NCSU CSC 579 (Introduction to Computer Performance Modeling) in 2019 Fall semester.

The goal is to verify the PASTA property (Poisson Arrivals See Time Average) in different Queueing Systems (MM1 and MMm) by plotting CCDF (Complementary Cumulative Distribution Function) in semi-log scale. The servers apply FCFS (First Come First Serve) policy.

## Requirements

The program was developed with Python 3.6.2.

Packages:

- matplotlib=3.1.1
- numpy=1.16.2
- xlwt

## Setup

run `mm1_analyzer` or `mmm_analyzer` and follow the instructions on the interface.
